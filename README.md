# Project Overview

This project is base on the concept of Test-Driven-Development. I use [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) to write test suites for the feedreader application(given by Udacity), to see weather the test will be passed or not.

## Getting start

* Download and extract the files
* Open the index.html file in your web browser

## More tips

* Test suites were written in the file "/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js"
* The functionality of feedreader app is implemented in "js/app.js"
